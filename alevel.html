I was never any good at anything art related as a child, but when I was about 14, an art teacher saw me in a Design and Tech class and suggested I do Graphic Design for GCSE. To set the scene, even the idea of studying art was bewildering because throughout my childhood I was groomed into thinking the only respectable professions were Doctors, Lawyers or Businessmen. So as time went by I realised I was “allowed” to think outside of this ideology and discovered my inner design talent which sparked an enormous amount of energy and determination.

I learnt how to draw, illustrate, design, understand colour theory and this is when I discovered Photoshop. Anyone who uses Adobe Creative Suite or any design package knows that this moment of discovery unleashes the creative ninja within. I became an avid reader of Computer Arts Magazine, went through every tutorial until I had enough skill to take my designs to the pro level. This motivation fuelled me into A - Level Graphic Design in which I proudly achieved a grade A, and to share some of my work I put together some of the best from that time.</p>

      	<div class="span12"><img src="images/tpyeIllustration.jpg"><p>Back then there was a huge demand for stylised hand drawn typography in posters, flyers, marketing and more. One of the most iconic designers was Si Scott, who inspired me so much I based my typography project from his influence which resulted in many designs such as this.</p></div>

      	<div class="span12"><img src="images/posters.jpg"><p>An advertising project to promote the showing of Gustav Klimt at the Tate Liverpool. This was the first project of my A - Level adventure and I had a lot of fun working on it. The final outcome was a poster with a mix of hand drawn elements, photography and typography.</p></div>

      <div class="row-fluid content">
      	<div class="span12"><img src="images/branding.jpg"><p>This project was a lot of fun. It was the first time the school gave us a Branding project which scared some people, but I thought it was a good change from all the drawing and a chance for some real problem solving, design style.

The brief was to design a set of packaging items of our choice for a fictional jewellery company named “Distinctive Designs.” I went for a set of products which included a small gift bag, tag and poster for the company. I learnt a whole lot about target audiences, how to design for them, product development, and along the way I had some fun with a few whacky experiments such as mixing silver foil under a card cutout of typography.

I really loved this kind of design work and to show that it was well received, the school used my work as a display and demo for future A - level students on their open evening visit.</p></div>
